<p>Also called 'the Renaissance man' because of his many brilliant ideas in the era, <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> is a wholesome man of skill, art, scuplture and amazing inventions. Not only was he a genious in the classical Fine Arts he is known for but, he was a genious in science and almost every study conducted. Such as, geology, mathematics, engineering, astronomy, botany, paleontology and even music. This is oddly really impressive sense, he gave himself no actual 'formal academic training'. He is very often considered being as great as Vincent van Gogh, meaning he is looked at as one of the greatest artists of all time and not just in his era. As a result, he is greatly respected and adored as the most 'talented' person to ever have lived among art professors all over the globe. His 2 most famous works include <em>&quot;The Mona Lisa&quot;</em>, which is the most popular known potrait in the entire world and <em>&quot;The Last Supper&quot;</em>, which is the most popular painting of all time in the religious ( Mostly known to christians of the church) community. </p>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci ( Leonardo wasn't really his true surname at all, &quot;in the modern sense—da Vinci simply meant "of Vinci"; his full birth name was <em>Lionardo di ser Piero da Vinci</em>&quot;.- wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" title="source for leonardo da vinci" target="_blank">Leonardo</a>) was a child birthed 'out-of-wedlock', meaning he was born to a woman who was not married from the conception to the date of birth of the child. No one really knows his presant mother's <em>true</em> idenity other than her name being believed to be &quot;Caterina di Meo Lippi&quot;. Some theories say she used to be a slave from a foregin country or a &quot;impoverished local youth&quot;. But, his father was known to be a rich Florentine legal notary named &quot;Messer Piero Fruosino di Antonio da Vinci&quot;. Leonardo was a child of common human curiosity. For an example, he wrote about a time he found a dark cave and while he was terrified at the thought of a monster living inside, he was thinking about what could be discovered inside. He also had an informal teaching about latin, geometry, and mathematics. His 1st or one of his famous early works, during his younger years, was a painting of <em>&quot;Medusa&quot;</em> that he was originally planning to give to a local peasant. But, his father was so horrified at the sight of the painting that he  immediately sold it to somebody else and gave the local peasant another individual shield. This painting however, along with many other ones, was never recovered.</p>
<p>Leonardo was a extremely fast learner. He learned from a very wide range of skills that helps him turn into a young genius in the future. Once he got into the art studio of  Verroocchio ( Verroocchio was the top leading  painter in Florence at the time. A true expert of his craft. ), he upgraded from a studio boy to being Verroocchio's art apprentice only by the age of 17. He was personally in training for around 7 years inside the studio. It is said that the works he showed , especially <em>&quot;The Baptism of Christ&quot;</em>, Verroocchio were so amazing compared to his that he said he would never ever paint again.</p>
